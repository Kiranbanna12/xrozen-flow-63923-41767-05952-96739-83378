**What Changed**:
- ✅ Creates member entry

- 📝 Stores user name in system_message_data

**System Message Creation**:
```typescript
const systemMessageData = JSON.stringify({
  type: 'join',
  user_name: displayName,
  user_id: userId
});

db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO messages (
    id, project_id, sender_id, content, 
    is_system_message, system_message_type, 
    system_message_data, created_at
  ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
`).run(
  systemMessageId,
  project_id,
  userId || null,
  `${displayName} joined the chat`,
  1, // is_system_message
  'join',
  systemMessageData,
  now
);
```

### 2. Remove Member Endpoint (New)

**Route**: `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/chat-members/:memberId`

**Authorization**: Requires authentication + admin check

**Checks**:
1. ✅ User is authenticated
2. ✅ Project exists
3. ✅ Requester is project creator (admin)
4. ✅ Member exists
5. ❌ Cannot remove yourself

**Actions**:
1. Deactivates member (`is_active = 0`)

  "success": true,
