# WhatsApp-Style Notification System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A complete notification system for the chat feature with unread message tracking, WhatsApp-style badges, and automatic read status management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅
- Added `project_last_read` table to track when users last viewed each chat
- Columns:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `project_id`: Foreign key to projects
  - `user_id`: Foreign key to users
  - `last_read_at`: Timestamp of last read
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Audit timestamps
- Indexes for optimal query performance on project_id, user_id, and updated_at

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** ✅

#### GET `/messages/unread/counts`
Returns unread message counts for all projects user has access to:
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "uuid",
      "project_name": "Project Name",
      "unread_count": 5,
      "last_message_at": "2025-10-11T10:30:00Z",
      "last_message_preview": "Last message text..."
    }
  ],
  "total_unread": 15
}
```

#### PUT `/messages/projects/:projectId/mark-read`
Marks all messages in a project as read by updating user's last_read_at timestamp.

### 3. **Chat List Enhancements** ✅

#### Sorting
- Chats automatically sorted by latest message timestamp
- Most recent conversations appear at the top
- Real-time reordering as new messages arrive

#### Unread Badges
- WhatsApp-style green badges (#25D366) showing unread count
- Badge displays on each chat item
- "99+" for counts over 99
- Badge disappears when chat is opened

#### Auto-Refresh
- Refreshes every 10 seconds to update counts
- Refreshes on window focus/visibility change
- Maintains scroll position during refresh

### 4. **Chat Window Integration** ✅

#### Auto-Mark as Read
- Marks project as read when chat window opens
- Updates `last_read_at` timestamp in database
- Automatically clears unread badge

#### Real-Time Status
- Continues to track message delivery/read status
- Shows blue WhatsApp ticks for read messages
- Gray ticks for delivered messages

### 5. **Sidebar Notification Badge** ✅

#### Total Unread Count
- Shows total unread messages across all chats
- WhatsApp green badge on "Chat" menu item
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Updates immediately when chats are opened

## Technical Implementation

### Database Query Logic
```sql
-- Get unread count for a project
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages 
WHERE project_id = ? 
  AND sender_id != ? 
  AND created_at > (
    SELECT last_read_at FROM project_last_read 
    WHERE project_id = ? AND user_id = ?
  )
```

### Frontend Components

**ChatList.tsx**
- Fetches unread counts via API
- Sorts chats by latest message
- Displays WhatsApp-style badges
- Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

**ChatWindow.tsx**
- Calls `markProjectAsRead()` on mount
- Updates last_read_at in database
- Clears unread count for current chat

**AppSidebar.tsx**
- Fetches total unread count
- Shows badge on Chat menu item
- Refreshes every 30 seconds

### API Client Methods
```typescript
apiClient.getUnreadCounts(): Promise<{ projects: any[]; total_unread: number }>
apiClient.markProjectAsRead(projectId: string): Promise<void>
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User receives new message**
   - Chat list automatically refreshes
   - Unread badge appears with count
   - Chat moves to top of list
   - Sidebar badge updates with total

2. **User opens chat**
   - ChatWindow calls markProjectAsRead()
   - Database updated with current timestamp
   - Badge disappears from chat item
   - Sidebar total count decreases

3. **User switches away**
   - New messages accumulate
   - Unread count increases
   - Badge reappears with new count

4. **Background refresh**
   - Chat list: Every 10 seconds
   - Sidebar: Every 30 seconds
   - On window focus/visibility change
   - Ensures counts stay current

## WhatsApp Design Elements

- **Green badge color**: #25D366 (WhatsApp official green)
- **Badge style**: Rounded full circles
- **Font size**: Small (text-xs)
- **Position**: Right-aligned in chat items, after menu title in sidebar
- **Animation**: Smooth appearance/disappearance
- **Behavior**: Same as WhatsApp (disappears when chat opened)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexed queries**: All unread count queries use indexes
2. **Batch operations**: Single API call fetches all unread counts
3. **Efficient sorting**: Database-level sorting by timestamp
4. **Minimal re-renders**: Only updates changed data
5. **Background refresh**: Staggered intervals (10s/30s) to reduce load

## Database Tables

### messages
- `id`, `project_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `created_at`, etc.

### project_last_read (NEW)
- `id`, `project_id`, `user_id`, `last_read_at`
- Tracks when each user last viewed each chat

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `scripts/init-database.js` - Added project_last_read table
2. `src/server/routes/messages.routes.ts` - Added unread count routes
3. `src/server/controllers/messages.controller.ts` - Added unread count methods

### Frontend
1. `src/lib/api-client.ts` - Added getUnreadCounts(), markProjectAsRead()
2. `src/components/chat/ChatList.tsx` - Sorting, badges, unread counts
3. `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx` - Auto-mark as read on open
4. `src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` - Total unread badge in sidebar
