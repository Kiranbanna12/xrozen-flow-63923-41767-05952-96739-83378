# Project Sharing Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive project sharing feature has been implemented for the Xrozen Flow video editing management platform. This feature allows project owners to share projects via unique links with granular permission control.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** (`supabase/migrations/20251011_project_sharing.sql`)
Created three new tables with RLS policies:

- **`project_shares`**: Stores shareable links with permissions
  - Fields: share_token, project_id, creator_id, can_view, can_edit, can_chat, is_active, expires_at
  - Permissions: read_only, can_edit (feedback), can_chat access
  - Unique token generation function included

- **`project_share_access_log`**: Tracks who accessed shared projects
  - Fields: share_id, user_id, guest_identifier, accessed_at, user_agent, ip_address
  - Helps track viewer analytics and access history

- **`project_chat_members`**: Manages chat participants
  - Fields: project_id, user_id, guest_name, share_id, joined_at, is_active
  - Supports both authenticated users and guest users

### 2. **Frontend Components**

### 4. **Backend API Routes** (`src/server/routes/project-sharing.routes.ts`)

**Endpoints Created**:

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/projects/:projectId/shares` | Required | Get all shares for a project |
| POST | `/api/project-shares` | Required | Create new share link |
| PUT | `/api/project-shares/:shareId` | Required | Update share settings |
| DELETE | `/api/project-shares/:shareId` | Required | Delete share link |
| GET | `/api/project-shares/token/:token` | Optional | Get share by token (public) |
| POST | `/api/project-shares/token/:token/log-access` | Optional | Log access to shared project |
| GET | `/api/projects/:projectId/share-access-logs` | Required | Get access logs |
| POST | `/api/project-chat-members` | Optional | Join project chat |
| GET | `/api/projects/:projectId/chat-members` | Optional | Get chat members |
| POST | `/api/shared-project-feedback` | Optional | Add feedback from shared users |

**Security Features**:
- Token-based authentication for owners
- Optional auth for public share access
- Permission verification on all operations
- Guest user support for non-authenticated access

### 5. **API Client Methods** (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)

Added methods:
```typescript
getProjectShares(projectId: string)
createProjectShare(data)
updateProjectShare(shareId: string, data)
deleteProjectShare(shareId: string)
getProjectShareByToken(token: string)
logShareAccess(token: string, data)
getProjectShareAccessLogs(projectId: string)
getProjectChatMembers(projectId: string)
joinProjectChat(data)
updateChatMemberStatus(memberId: string, isActive: boolean)
addSharedProjectFeedback(data)
```

### 6. **Chat Integration** (`src/lib/chat-api-client.ts`)

Added:
```typescript
sendSystemMessage(conversationId: string, data)
```
- Sends system notifications (e.g., "User joined the chat")
- Supports metadata for event tracking

### 7. **Routing** (`src/App.tsx`)

Added route:
```typescript
<Route path="/shared/:shareToken" element={<SharedProject />} />
```

## User Workflows

### Sharing a Project (Owner)
1. Click "Share" button on Projects page or Project Details page
2. Select permissions: View (always on), Edit (feedback), Chat access
3. Click "Create Share Link"
4. Copy generated link and share with collaborators
5. Monitor access in "Access Log" tab
6. Manage links in "Active Links" tab

### Accessing Shared Project (Recipient)
1. Click on shared link (format: `/shared/{unique-token}`)
2. View project details (no payments/fees visible)
3. See permission badges indicating access level
4. If Edit permission: Add feedback on video versions
5. If Chat permission: Click "Join Chat" button
6. Enter name (if not logged in) and join
7. Chat system announces: "{Name} joined the chat"

### Chat Participation
1. Shared users with chat access can join project chats
2. Guest users provide display name
3. Authenticated users join with their profile
4. System message notifies all participants
5. Full chat functionality available (send messages, reactions, etc.)

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design Consistency
- Follows existing Xrozen Flow design system
- Uses shadcn/ui components throughout
- Gradient primary buttons for CTAs
- Elegant shadows and card styling
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

### Permission Visualization
- Color-coded badges (View, Edit, Chat)
- Clear permission explanations
- Lock icons for restricted access
- Status indicators (Active/Inactive)

### Access Tracking
- Real-time access counts
- Unique viewer statistics
- Detailed access logs with timestamps
- User identification (authenticated vs guest)

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**: 32-character unique tokens, collision-checked
2. **Permission Validation**: Server-side checks on every operation
3. **RLS Policies**: Database-level access control
4. **Optional Authentication**: Supports both logged-in and guest users
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete access logging for compliance
6. **Link Management**: Owners can deactivate/delete links anytime

## Technical Implementation Details

### Token Generation
- Cryptographically random 32-character tokens
- Base64-encoded with URL-safe characters
- Uniqueness verified before creation
- Stored in database with project association

### Access Logging
- Automatic logging on share access
- Captures: user_id, IP, user_agent, timestamp
- Guest identifier for non-authenticated users
- Aggregated statistics for analytics

### Chat Integration
- Seamless integration with existing chat system
- System messages for join/leave events
- Guest user support with display names
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Migration Required

To use this feature, run the migration:
```sql
\i supabase/migrations/20251011_project_sharing.sql
```

This will:
- Create new tables
- Set up RLS policies
- Add helper functions
- Create indexes for performance
