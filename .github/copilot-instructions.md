# GitHub Copilot Instructions for This Project

## CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### ‚ùå DO NOT CREATE THESE FILES:
1. **NO Markdown (.md) files** - Never create documentation, summary, or guide files in .md format
2. **NO explanation files** - Do not create files that explain changes or implementations
3. **NO summary files** - Do not create files that summarize work done
4. **NO guide files** - Do not create step-by-step guide files
5. **NO documentation files** - Do not create separate documentation files unless explicitly requested

### ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:
- Make direct code changes in existing files
- Use inline comments in code files when explanation is needed
- Provide verbal explanation in chat only
- Focus on implementation, not documentation
- If user asks for explanation, provide it in chat response only

### üìù EXCEPTIONS (Only when user explicitly asks):
- User specifically requests: "create a README file"
- User specifically requests: "create documentation"
- User asks: "write this in a markdown file"

### üéØ WORKFLOW:
1. User asks for a feature ‚Üí Implement it directly in code
2. User asks to fix something ‚Üí Fix it directly in code
3. User asks "how does it work?" ‚Üí Explain in chat, DO NOT create .md file
4. User asks "what did you change?" ‚Üí Explain in chat, DO NOT create summary file

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES:

### File Operations:
- Only edit/create .tsx, .ts, .jsx, .js, .css, .json, .sql files when implementing features
- Do not create parallel documentation for code changes
- Keep workspace clean - no redundant files

### Communication Style:
- Be concise in responses
- Code first, explain later
- Don't waste time on documentation that won't be read

## REMEMBER:
**The workspace already has too many .md files. DO NOT ADD MORE unless explicitly requested by the user with clear intent to create documentation.**

---
*These instructions are permanent for this workspace. Follow them strictly.*
